## The project title
### **New York City  HIV/AIDS Report**
**A HIV Epidemiological report aimed to investigate the correlation between HIV infection and socioeconomic status, population distribution, and medical resources in New York City.**

### Motivation 
  HIV/AIDS are still  a significant public health challenge,in 2020, there were 100,712 people living with HIV in New York City. The vast population diversity and economic disparities of New York City, provide a unique landscape for studying how socioeconomic status, population distribution, and medical resources intersect to influence HIV infection rates within the in a dense urban environment city.
  The medical resource and economic status distribution often varies greatly across different boroughs and neighborhoods in nyc.Investigating how these disparities relate to HIV prevalence can shed light on the broader implications of socioeconomic on epidemiology and develop more targeted intervention strategies base on the different demographics condition. 

## Intended final products

* **Data  Processing**: Introduction the data sources,explain the process of data collection and cleaning. 

*  **Exploratory analyses Report**: A comprehensive report about  HIV trends in New York that include the factors such as infection rates, demographic data,and medical resource distribution.

* **Visualizations plot**: Create the  charts, graphs, and maps showcasing the geographical spread of HIV in New York, infection rates in different race,sex and age. Showing the correlation between HIV prevalence and socioeconomic disparities, such as the impact of rates of sexual assault and drug-related crimes." Compare the HIV medical resource distribution with prevalance map.  

* **Statistics analysis** : An illustrative page that introduce the  statistics methodology in the analysis,the result and the diagnostics. 

* **Summary** A concise summary highlighting key findings, result and discussion of project.  
 
*  **Interactive Website**: A interactive website integrated the project products that allow users to visit the project reportand explore the data . 

* **Video Screenshot**: A two-minute narrated screencast illustrating your project.
