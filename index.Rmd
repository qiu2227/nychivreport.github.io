### Motivation 
  HIV/AIDS are still  a significant public health challenge,in 2020, there were 100,712 people living with HIV in New York City. The vast population diversity and economic disparities of New York City, provide a unique landscape for studying how socioeconomic status, population distribution, and medical resources intersect to influence HIV infection rates within the in a dense urban environment city.
  The medical resource and economic status distribution often varies greatly across different boroughs and neighborhoods in nyc.Investigating how these disparities relate to HIV prevalence can shed light on the broader implications of socioeconomic on epidemiology and develop more targeted intervention strategies base on the different demographics condition.

### Data
To prepare the data analysis, we load these following libraries:

* `tidyverse`
* `rvest`
* `httr`
* `plotly`
* `ggplot2`
* `leaflet`
* `caret`

library(rvest)
library(httr)
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
library(leaflet)
library(caret)
```

# Data processing

The datasets used in this study were sourced from the NYC OpenData portal, a public platform offering diverse datasets from New York City agencies. We utilized the R programming language, employing the `httr` package to perform HTTP GET requests for retrieving the data. Specifically, two datasets, `nyc_HIV1` and `nyc_HIV2`, were accessed from distinct URLs with set record limits of 10,000 and 22,000 respectively. These datasets, containing information on HIV statistics, were parsed and filtered to include data from the year 2017 onwards. Additionally, a dataset for HIV service resources, `HIV_service`, was similarly obtained with a record limit of 1,000. This dataset was processed to select critical columns like facility information and geographical coordinates. This process ensured a comprehensive and tailored extraction of data pertinent to our analysis of HIV trends and resources in New York City.

We input the New York HIV data from NYC opendata 
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nyc_HIV1=
  GET("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/ykvb-493p.csv",
  query = list("$limit" = 10000)) |>
  content("parsed")|>
  filter(year >= 2017)


nyc_HIV2=
  GET("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/dxnu-p2qd.csv",
  query = list("$limit" = 22000)) |>
  content("parsed")|>
  filter(year >= 2017)
  
```

And input HIV service resource data
```{r message=FALSE}
HIV_service=
  GET("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/pwts-g83w.csv",
  query = list("$limit" = 1000)) |>
  content("parsed")|>
  select(unique_id,facilityname,service_type, address,borough,state,zipcode,latitude,longitude)
  
```


```{r}
colnames(nyc_HIV1)
colnames(nyc_HIV2)
colnames(HIV_service)
```

# Results

## Gender Differences in HIV Prevalence

A Welch Two Sample t-test was conducted to compare the prevalence of HIV diagnoses between female and male populations. The analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in the number of HIV diagnoses between females (\(\bar{x} = 6.14\)) and males (\(\bar{x} = 26.94\)), \(t(1921.9) = -8.183\), \(p < .00001\). The 95% confidence interval for the difference in means ranged from -25.78 to -15.81, indicating a higher prevalence of HIV diagnoses in males compared to females.

## HIV Diagnoses Across Ethnicities

An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed to examine whether the number of HIV diagnoses significantly differed across various ethnic groups. The results indicated a significant effect of race on the number of HIV diagnoses, \(F(5, 5173) = 59.623\), \(p < .00001\). This finding suggests substantial disparities in HIV diagnoses among different racial groups.

## HIV Prevalence Among Different Age Groups

Further, an ANOVA was conducted to assess the impact of age on HIV diagnoses. The analysis showed a significant difference in the number of HIV diagnoses among different age groups, \(F(6, 10569) = 178.22\), \(p < .00001\). This result highlights the varying prevalence of HIV across age demographics.


These findings collectively offer valuable insights into the epidemiological patterns of HIV diagnoses in New York City, highlighting significant disparities based on gender, race, and age. Such disparities underscore the need for targeted public health interventions and policies to address the unique needs of these demographic groups.

# Discussion

## Findings from the Analysis
 * Gender and HIV Prevalence: There tends to be a difference in HIV infection rates and diagnosis numbers between males and females.In the analysis we conducted, it was found that the number of HIV diagnoses was significantly higher in males compared to females. 
 * Ethnic Disparities in HIV Diagnoses: Our ANOVA tests revealed significant differences in HIV diagnoses among different races and age groups,emphasizing the persistence of inequities in HIV prevalence.
 * Variation Across Boroughs: The linear regression analysis showed significant differences in HIV diagnoses among the boroughs of New York City. Boroughs like Staten Island exhibited the largest negative coefficients in the model, indicating a lower number of HIV diagnoses compared to other regions. The differences are possibly influenced by factors such as local public health policies, access to healthcare services, and community-level prevention efforts.
 * Trends in HIV Infections: Our analysis indicated an 31% decrease in new HIV infections from 2017 to 2021, suggesting a gradual but steady progress in controlling new infections.
 
## Insights and Reflections
Our findings provide critical insights into the multifaceted nature of HIV epidemiology in New York City. The results underscore the necessity of addressing social and structural factors, such as racism, sexism, economic factors, homophobia, and transphobia. These determinants can influence risk behaviors, access to healthcare, and overall health outcomes.

While some findings, such as the disparities in HIV diagnoses among different demographics, were expected, the impact of external factors like the COVID-19 pandemic on the patterns of HIV diagnoses was particularly intriguing. It highlights the dynamic nature of public health challenges and the need for adaptive and resilient healthcare systems.


The insights gained from this analysis can aid in the development of more nuanced and effective public health strategies. These strategies should not only be responsive to the unique needs of different demographics but also adaptable to the specific challenges faced by each borough and race. By addressing these multifaceted aspects, New York City can continue to make progress towards reducing HIV infections and improving outcomes for people living with HIV.
