### **New York City  HIV/AIDS Report**
**A HIV Epidemiological report aimed to investigate the correlation between HIV infection and socioeconomic status, population distribution, and medical resources in New York City.**

<img src="images/hiv.png" style="height:80%;">

### Motivation 
  HIV/AIDS are still  a significant public health challenge,in 2020, there were 100,712 people living with HIV in New York City. The vast population diversity and economic disparities of New York City, provide a unique landscape for studying how socioeconomic status, population distribution, and medical resources intersect to influence HIV infection rates within the in a dense urban environment city.
  The medical resource and economic status distribution often varies greatly across different boroughs and neighborhoods in nyc.Investigating how these disparities relate to HIV prevalence can shed light on the broader implications of socioeconomic on epidemiology and develop more targeted intervention strategies base on the different demographics condition. 

### Data
To prepare the data analysis, we load these following libraries:

* `tidyverse`
* `rvest`
* `httr`
* `plotly`
* `ggplot2`
* `leaflet`
* `caret`

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(httr)
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
library(leaflet)
library(caret)
```

# Data processing

The datasets used in this study were sourced from the NYC OpenData portal, a public platform offering diverse datasets from New York City agencies. We utilized the R programming language, employing the `httr` package to perform HTTP GET requests for retrieving the data. Specifically, two datasets, `nyc_HIV1` and `nyc_HIV2`, were accessed from distinct URLs with set record limits of 10,000 and 22,000 respectively. These datasets, containing information on HIV statistics, were parsed and filtered to include data from the year 2017 onwards. Additionally, a dataset for HIV service resources, `HIV_service`, was similarly obtained with a record limit of 1,000. This dataset was processed to select critical columns like facility information and geographical coordinates. This process ensured a comprehensive and tailored extraction of data pertinent to our analysis of HIV trends and resources in New York City.

Female <- nyc_HIV1 %>% 
  filter(sex == "Female" & borough == "All" & race !="All")

Male <- nyc_HIV1 %>% 
  filter(sex == "Male"  & borough == "All" & race !="All")

graph1 = bind_rows(Female, Male)

ggplot(graph1, aes(x=race, y=hiv_diagnoses_num, fill=sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge()) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(x = "Race", y = "Number of HIV/AIDS Diagnoses", fill = "Sex")



# Graph Age 
age_summary <- nyc_HIV2 %>%
  filter(age != "All" & race == "All" & borough == "All") %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  summarise(total_hiv_diagnoses = sum(hiv_diagnoses_num))

ggplot(age_summary, aes(x = age, y = total_hiv_diagnoses)) +

       y = "Total HIV Diagnoses") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

The bar chart titled "Total HIV Diagnoses by Age Group" presents the distribution of HIV diagnoses across various age groups. The x-axis categorizes the data into age ranges: 13-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60+. The y-axis represents the count of total HIV diagnoses. A prominent observation from the chart is that the highest number of diagnoses occurs in the 20-29 age group, followed by the 30-39 age group, suggesting a higher incidence of HIV in these younger demographics. The number of diagnoses declines with increasing age, with the fewest cases in the youngest (13-19) and oldest (60+) age brackets. This visual representation highlights the importance of targeted HIV prevention and education efforts towards younger populations who are significantly more affected.

summary:

**Distribution of the HIV/AIDS diagnoses by neighborhood.** 
```{r warning=FALSE}
#work
# I'll see if I can find the log&lat for the neighborhoods
diagnoses <- nyc_HIV1 %>% 
  select(borough, hiv_diagnoses_num)

# Plot bar chart
ggplot(diagnoses, aes(x = reorder(borough, hiv_diagnoses_num), y = hiv_diagnoses_num)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Neighborhood",
       y = "Number of HIV Diagnoses",
       title = "HIV Diagnoses by Neighborhood") +
  coord_flip()
```

The horizontal bar chart titled "HIV Diagnoses by Neighborhood" displays the number of HIV diagnoses across different neighborhoods in New York City. The x-axis quantifies the number of HIV diagnoses, while the y-axis lists the neighborhoods, including Staten Island, Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and a category for 'All', which may represent the total across all neighborhoods or a category for unclassified data.Brooklyn appears to have the highest number of HIV diagnoses, followed by Manhattan and Queens. The Bronx and Staten Island have comparatively fewer diagnoses. This distribution highlights the varying impact of HIV across different areas, which may reflect differences in population density, access to healthcare, or effectiveness of public health interventions. Understanding this variability is crucial for targeted HIV prevention and treatment strategies.

**Trend analysis:analyze the trend of the number of HIV/AIDS diagnoses over time.**
```{r}
All <- nyc_HIV1 %>% 
  filter(sex == "All" & race == "All" & borough == "All")

# Plot diagnoses over time
ggplot(All, aes(x = year, y = hiv_diagnoses_num)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
  labs(
    title = "HIV Diagnoses Trend (All Sex)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of Diagnoses"
  )
```

The scatter plot with a trend line, titled "HIV Diagnoses Trend (All Sex)," illustrates the number of HIV/AIDS diagnoses from 2017 through 2021. The x-axis represents the year, and the y-axis indicates the number of diagnoses. Each dot corresponds to the total diagnoses reported in a given year. The blue line represents a linear regression model, showing a clear downward trend in the number of diagnoses over the five-year period. This suggests a significant decrease in new HIV/AIDS cases annually, which could be indicative of effective public health interventions, increased awareness, and advancements in preventive measures. The consistent decline over consecutive years highlights a positive direction in the fight against HIV/AIDS.

**Test whether there is a significant difference between people of different races and different age groups.**
```{r}
race_table <- table(nyc_HIV1$race, nyc_HIV1$sex)
race_table
# Perform chi-square test
chisq.test(race_table)
```
summary:
The chi-square test passes the test of significance, indicating that there is a significant relationship between race and gender.

#### Linear regression analysis
```{r}
# Defining a Unique Thermal Coding Processor
library(caret)
encoder <- dummyVars(~ borough + sex + race, data = nyc_HIV1)
# Solo thermal coding of data
encoded_data <- predict(encoder, newdata = nyc_HIV1)
# Merging the coded and original data sets
nyc_HIV3 <- cbind(nyc_HIV1, encoded_data)
nyc_HIV4<-nyc_HIV3[,-c(2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,18,21)]
model <- lm(hiv_diagnoses_num ~. , data = nyc_HIV4)
summary(model)
```
**Summary:**
The coefficients of all variables passed the significance test, indicating that all of these independent variables have a significant effect on hiv_diagnoses_num. The coefficient before the variable "boroughStaten\\\nIsIand" has the largest absolute value, which means that it has the largest effect on the number of HIV patients. In addition, the coefficients before these variables are all negative, indicating that they all negatively affect hiv_diagnoses_num.Finally, the multiple linear regression model constructed ishiv_diagnoses_num=4514.4981-2.0224*year-354.5227*boroughBronx-358.4969*boroughBrooklyn-362.8923*boroughManhattan-363.2155*boroughQueens-373.2117*boroughStaten\\nIsland-26.8822*sexFemale-6.1453*sexMale-62.6910*raceAsian /Pacific\\nIslander-36.4375*raceBlack-41.7176*raceLatino/Hispanic-65.3393*raceOther/Unknown-57.9514*raceWhite.

#### Regression model test
```{r}
#Drawing demonstration
par(mfrow=c(2, 2))  
plot(model)

# Plot of predicted values against residuals
residuals <- resid(model)
fitted_values <- predict(model)
plot(fitted_values, residuals,
     xlab = "Fitted values",
     ylab = "Residuals",
     main = "Residuals vs. Fitted")
abline(h = 0, col = "red")
```

**Summary:Here is a test of the effectiveness of the regression model constructed above. Use plot(model) to draw residual plots, scatter plots and other diagnostic plots. Residual plots are used to check for linear properties, heteroskedasticity, outliers, etc. Scatter plots can be used to check for correlation between independent variables, and QQ plots are used to check whether the residuals conform to the assumption of normal distribution. Here, we can see that the residuals do not conform well to normality and randomness. Analyzing the reason, it may be due to the existence of individual outliers, which affects the distribution of the data and the distribution of the residuals, making them not conform to normality and randomness.**

# Findings from the Analysis

 * Gender and HIV Prevalence: There tends to be a difference in HIV infection rates and diagnosis numbers between males and females.In the analysis we conducted, it was found that the number of HIV diagnoses was significantly higher in males compared to females. 
 * Ethnic Disparities in HIV Diagnoses: Our ANOVA tests revealed significant differences in HIV diagnoses among different races and age groups,emphasizing the persistence of inequities in HIV prevalence.
 * Variation Across Boroughs: The linear regression analysis showed significant differences in HIV diagnoses among the boroughs of New York City. Boroughs like Staten Island exhibited the largest negative coefficients in the model, indicating a lower number of HIV diagnoses compared to other regions. The differences are possibly influenced by factors such as local public health policies, access to healthcare services, and community-level prevention efforts.
 * Trends in HIV Infections: Our analysis indicated an 31% decrease in new HIV infections from 2017 to 2021, suggesting a gradual but steady progress in controlling new infections.
 
## Insights and Reflections
Our findings provide critical insights into the multifaceted nature of HIV epidemiology in New York City. The results underscore the necessity of addressing social and structural factors, such as racism, sexism, economic factors, homophobia, and transphobia. These determinants can influence risk behaviors, access to healthcare, and overall health outcomes.

While some findings, such as the disparities in HIV diagnoses among different demographics, were expected, the impact of external factors like the COVID-19 pandemic on the patterns of HIV diagnoses was particularly intriguing. It highlights the dynamic nature of public health challenges and the need for adaptive and resilient healthcare systems.


The insights gained from this analysis can aid in the development of more nuanced and effective public health strategies. These strategies should not only be responsive to the unique needs of different demographics but also adaptable to the specific challenges faced by each borough and race. By addressing these multifaceted aspects, New York City can continue to make progress towards reducing HIV infections and improving outcomes for people living with HIV.
